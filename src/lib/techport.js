In May 2013, President Obama signed into law Executive Order 13642, Making Open and
Machine Readable the New Default for Government Information. This requirement promotes
continued job growth, government efficiency, and the social good that can be gained from
opening government data to the public. In order to facilitate the Open Data initiatives,
government information is managed as an asset throughout its life cycle to promote
interoperability and openness, and wherever possible and legally permissible, released to the
public in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable.
NASA is committed to making its data available and machine-readable through an Application
Programming Interface (API) to better serve its user communities. NASAs TechPort system
provides a RESTful web services API to make technology Program and Project data available in
a machine-readable format. This API can be used to export TechPort data into an XML format,
which can be further processed and analyzed.
